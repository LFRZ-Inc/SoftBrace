# Build Fix Log

## Issue Resolution - December 2024

### 🐛 **Problem Identified**
- **Vercel deployment failure** due to corrupted image files
- **GitHub Actions failure** during build process
- **Root Cause:** Two corrupted image files were causing build failures:
  - `public/images/softbrace-logos.jpg` (192 bytes - corrupted)
  - `public/images/softbrace-usage-example.jpg` (252 bytes - corrupted)

### 🔧 **Solution Applied**
1. **Identified corrupted files** using file size analysis
2. **Removed corrupted images** that were causing build failures
3. **Verified local build** completed successfully after cleanup
4. **Merged remote changes** from GitHub to sync repositories
5. **Pushed fix** to resolve deployment issues

### ✅ **Resolution Steps**
```bash
# 1. Identified corrupted files
Get-ChildItem public/images/ | Where-Object {$_.Length -lt 1000}

# 2. Removed corrupted files
Remove-Item "public/images/softbrace-logos.jpg" -Force
Remove-Item "public/images/softbrace-usage-example.jpg" -Force

# 3. Verified build works locally
npm run build  # ✅ Success

# 4. Committed and pushed fix
git add .
git commit -m "Fix build failure: remove corrupted image files"
git pull origin master  # Merge remote changes
git commit -m "Merge remote changes with corruption fix"
git push origin master  # ✅ Success
```

### 📊 **Build Verification**
- ✅ **Local Build:** Successful
- ✅ **Image Copy Script:** Working correctly
- ✅ **Git Push:** Completed successfully
- ✅ **No Code References:** Corrupted images were not referenced in code
- ✅ **Clean Removal:** No broken links or missing assets

### 🚀 **Current Status**
- **GitHub Repository:** ✅ Updated and synced
- **Local Environment:** ✅ Clean and building
- **Vercel Deployment:** 🔄 Should now deploy successfully
- **Image Assets:** ✅ All valid images preserved

### 📋 **Valid Images Preserved**
The following legitimate image files remain intact:
- `15 Pack.png` (2.1MB)
- `31 Pack.png` (2.3MB)  
- `5 Pack.png` (2.4MB)
- `Real 5 Pack.jpeg` (1.3MB)
- `SoftBrace Products.png` (16.6MB)
- And other valid product images...

### 🔍 **Prevention Measures**
- Added file size validation for future image uploads
- Verified all remaining images are valid and properly sized
