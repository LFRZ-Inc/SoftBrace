# 🚀 Immediate Action Plan - Fix Missing Order

## ✅ **Step 1: Code Deployed to GitHub**
All fixes have been pushed to GitHub successfully! The webhook is now fixed to process guest orders and capture shipping addresses.

## 🔧 **Step 2: Update Database Schema**
You need to run the database schema update in your Supabase dashboard:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → Your Project → SQL Editor
2. **Copy and paste** the contents of `database-schema-update.sql`
3. **Run the script** to add missing fields

**What this adds:**
- `order_status`, `stripe_session_id`, `verification_status`
- `fulfillment_status`, `requires_manual_review`, `review_reason`
- `customer_email` (for guest orders)
- `unit_price`, `total_price` in order_items
- `products` table for Stripe price ID mapping

## 🔍 **Step 3: Find Your Missing Order**
Run this in your terminal (with your environment variables set):

```bash
node find-missing-order.js
```

This will show you:
- All recent checkout sessions
- **Shipping addresses** for each order
- Which orders are paid but missing from database
- Customer email addresses

## 🛠️ **Step 4: Recover the Missing Order**
Once you find the missing order, recover it with full address data:

```bash
node -e "
const { recoverMissingOrder } = require('./recover-missing-order.js');
recoverMissingOrder('SESSION_ID_HERE')
  .then(order => {
    console.log('✅ Order recovered with address:', order);
    console.log('📍 Shipping address:', order.shipping_address);
  })
  .catch(error => console.error('❌ Recovery failed:', error));
"
```

Replace `SESSION_ID_HERE` with the actual session ID from Step 3.

## 🧪 **Step 5: Test the Fix**
1. **Deploy the updated webhook** (if using Vercel, it should auto-deploy)
2. **Test with a guest checkout** (add items, checkout without logging in)
3. **Verify the order appears** in your database with shipping address

## 📧 **Step 6: Address Email Access Issue**
For your Google Workspace payment issue:

### Immediate Solutions:
1. **Contact Google Support** - They can help restore access even with payment issues
2. **Use Alternative Email** - Update Stripe webhook notifications to a working email
3. **Check Stripe Dashboard** - All order notifications are visible there

### Long-term:
1. Resolve Google Workspace payment
2. Update all business email configurations

## 🎯 **Expected Results**
After completing these steps:
- ✅ Missing order will be recovered with full address data
- ✅ All future guest orders will be processed correctly
- ✅ Shipping addresses will be captured for all orders
- ✅ You'll have access to customer delivery information

## 🆘 **If You Need Help**
1. Check the recovery script logs for specific errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure Supabase service key has proper permissions
4. Test webhook endpoint manually if needed

**Priority Order:**
1. **Database Schema Update** (Critical - must be done first)
2. **Find Missing Order** (High - to recover the lost order)
3. **Recover Missing Order** (High - to get customer address)
4. **Test Fix** (Medium - to verify everything works)
5. **Email Access** (Low - can be addressed later)
