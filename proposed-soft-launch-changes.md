# Proposed Changes for SoftBraceStrips.com Soft Launch

Below are the proposed updates to move the site from "Coming Soon" mode to a full soft launch. These changes make the site look and function like a live, active store without altering any of the existing functionality like Stripe Checkout.

## 1. Soft Launch Banner

A new prominent banner will be added at the top of the site, indicating that the site is now in soft launch mode:

```
[Soft Launch] Now Open for Early Orders—Thank You for Supporting Our Launch!
```

The banner will appear on all main pages (Home, Shop, Product) to maintain consistency.

## 2. Homepage Hero Updates

The hero section will be updated:
- "Coming Late May" changed to "Now Available!"
- "Learn More" button changed to "Shop Now" (linked to the shop page)
- Added a second button for "Learn More" that scrolls down to the product section
- Updated styling to make the availability announcement more prominent

## 3. Product Section Updates

The Product section will be updated:
- New headline: "SoftBrace is here—gum comfort for every smile"
- Each product pack now has an "Add to Cart" button that links directly to that product's page
- The "Shop Coming Soon" button is now an enabled "Shop Now" button that links to the shop page
- Removed all disabled states and "coming soon" messaging

## 4. Text/Label Updates

All "coming soon" text throughout the site has been replaced with active shopping language:
- English and Spanish translations updated
