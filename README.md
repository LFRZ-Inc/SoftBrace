npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Stripe publishable key:
```
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_publishable_key_here
```

4. Start the development server

## Deployment Instructions

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended for E-commerce)

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Add the following environment variables in Vercel project settings:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Your Stripe secret key
   - `REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Your Stripe publishable key
3. Ensure the project uses the Vercel configuration in `vercel.json`
4. Deploy the project

### GitHub Pages Deployment

For GitHub Pages deployment (note: API functionality will not work with GitHub Pages):

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will build the project and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

## Stripe Integration

The e-commerce functionality uses Stripe for payment processing. To set up Stripe:

1. Create a Stripe account and get your API keys
2. Add your Stripe publishable key to `.env` file
3. When deploying to Vercel, add your Stripe secret key as an environment variable
4. The API route at `/api/create-checkout-session` handles creating Stripe checkout sessions

   - When using GitHub Pages, API routes aren't supported
   - Vercel deployment requires proper configuration in `vercel.json`

3. **Missing Environment Variables**
   - Make sure all required environment variables are set in Vercel

4. **Image Loading Issues**
   - Ensure images are properly referenced with correct paths
   - The build script includes a copy-images.js that copies images to the build folder
