2. **Search for customer ID**: `gcus_1S7EECFsjDil30gTGq96Q8un`
3. **Click on the customer** to see their details

    console.log('✅ Order recovered:', order);
    console.log('📍 Shipping address:', order.shipping_address);
  })
  .catch(err => console.error('❌ Error:', err));
"
```

## 🔍 **Method 2: Using Script (Requires Stripe Keys)**

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root:

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
SUPABASE_URL=https://ebodynepuqrocggtevdw.supabase.co

```

### Step 2: Run the Search Script
```bash
node find-jennifer-by-customer-id.js
```

### Step 3: Recover the Order
The script will show you the session ID and recovery command.

## 📍 **What You'll Get When Recovered**

The recovered order will include:

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

1. **The webhook is now fixed** - all future guest orders will be processed correctly
