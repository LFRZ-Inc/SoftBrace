            <div className="faq-answer">
              <p>SoftBrace Strips are made from FDA-compliant, platinum-cured silicone that is soft, flexible, and designed to protect your mouth from bracket irritation. While they're durable, they are intended for short-term relief and single use.</p>

            </div>
            <div className="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes! SoftBrace Strips are compatible with most types of orthodontic appliances, including traditional metal braces, ceramic braces, and some clear aligners. The soft, flexible material molds to different shapes for a better fit.</p>

              <h3>How do I apply SoftBrace Strips correctly?</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="faq-answer">
              <p>Gently press the strip onto the gum area directly above or below the brackets, wherever you're experiencing irritationâ€”not on the brackets themselves. The strip should cover the sensitive tissue where braces tend to rub. Trim if needed, and press gently until secure.</p>
