            <p className="mb-4">
              Orthodontic treatment can cause several types of discomfort:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
              <li className="mb-2"><strong>Bracket Irritation:</strong> Metal or ceramic brackets can rub against the inside of your cheeks and lips, causing painful sores.</li>
              <li className="mb-2"><strong>Wire Poking:</strong> The end of a wire may sometimes poke your cheek or the back of your mouth.</li>
              <li className="mb-2"><strong>General Soreness:</strong> After adjustments, your teeth may feel sore as they begin to shift.</li>
              <li className="mb-2"><strong>Cheek and Tongue Biting:</strong> It's common to accidentally bite your cheeks or tongue while adjusting to braces.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Traditional solutions like orthodontic wax provide temporary relief but require frequent reapplication and can be messy. 
              <strong> SoftBrace strips offer a revolutionary alternative</strong> with longer-lasting protection and superior comfort.

            <p className="mb-4">
              While dental wax has been the go-to solution for decades, it comes with several drawbacks:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
              <li className="mb-2">Needs frequent reapplication, often multiple times per day</li>
              <li className="mb-2">Can be messy and difficult to apply properly</li>
              <li className="mb-2">May fall off while eating or speaking</li>
              <li className="mb-2">Provides inconsistent protection</li>
              <li className="mb-2">Can be visible on braces</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
